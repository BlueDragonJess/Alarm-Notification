# Description of project
 This is a simple project made while I was first learning Python.
 
 Afraid to wake up late? What should we do?
 
 Well... Most people use an alarm to go around that issue, setting an hour in our phones so a song/music plays to wake us up from our slumber, 
and the moment we press the "Set" or "Save" buttom a notification pop's in the bottom of our phones displaying how long we have until the alarm goes off.

  Ever wondered how do we set that small little notification code in Python?
 
  Well... Here is a similar code for this challenge which I used to make an exercise in one of my online classes, where the user is asked the current hours 
 and how long they wish to wait until the alarm goes off, before the program calculates it for the user and tells how many days thats going to take and the 
 hours that's going to fall into.

Note: This is the first project that I am uploading in Github, and I am still trying to learn my way around the platform and all it as to offer
