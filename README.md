# Description of project
 This is a simple project made while I was first learning Python.
 
 Afraid to wake up late? What should we do?
 
 Well... Most people use an alarm to go around that issue, setting an hour in our phones so a song/music plays to wake us up from our slumber, 
and the moment we press the "Set" or "Save" buttom a notification pop's in the bottom of our phones displaying how long we have until the alarm goes off.

 Ever wondered how do we set that small little notification code in Python?
 
 Well... Here is the code I used to make an exercise in one of my online classes.
