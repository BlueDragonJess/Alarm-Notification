# Description of project
 This is a simple project made while I was first learning Python.

 With this project I'm creating a program capable of calculating the amount of days and hours the user has to wait from a given hour and a given time to
 wait from.

# Acknowledgements 
 A better understanding of simple calculations on a useful function to be used on a future more complex context.
